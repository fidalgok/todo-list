# todo-list
Holding place for my todo list project code

This todo list is coming from the online class I'm taking. I'll update the code here as it becomes more and more complex to practice using github as a repository for code.

The todoApp folder contains the final code for the project with interactive javascript. You can dynamically create a todolist on the static website.
